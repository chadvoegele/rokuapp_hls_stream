# Description
This is a Roku app that displays HLS streams. The app expects the stream to require basic HTTP authentication and prompts the user for a password. The stream url and username are stored in [source/config.brs](app/source/config.brs).

# Example HLS Stream Source
VLC can be used to create HLS streams. Use "access=livehttp".
